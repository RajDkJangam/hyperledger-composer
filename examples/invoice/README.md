# E-Invoice

When an individual `I` or company `CA` buys s.th. from another company `CB`, `CB` should deliver an E-Invoice to `I` or `CA` as a proof of the sale.

The e-invoice receipt can be used for reimbursement only from the titled company. Before reimbursement, it can be transferred from one individual/company to another.

On reimbursement acceptance and rejection, relevant events will be triggered.
