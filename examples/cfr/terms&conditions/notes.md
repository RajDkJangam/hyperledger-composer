# Special Notes

## Crashed Test Vehicles

The United States Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) purchases and provides passenger cars, light trucks and school buses as Government Furnished Property to contractors to conduct various compliance and experimental crash tests related to motor vehicle safety. After completion of testing, GSA sells these vehicles as "not repairable for highway use" (used for parts or scrap metal only).

Purchasers of crashed test vehicles must sign a disclaimer statement acknowledging in writing that he/she understands that the property is sold for parts or scrap only and is "not repairable for highway use (NRHU)"; agrees not to attempt to repair the vehicle for highway use; and further agrees to notify any subsequent purchaser of this NRHU stipulation.

Purchasers of crashed test vehicles will receive a GSA Form 27A, "Purchaser's Receipt and Authority to Release Property," and a Standard Form (SF) 97, "The United States Government Certificate To Obtain Title To A Vehicle" marked with "NOT TO BE TITLED FOR HIGHWAY USE" statement. This SF97 is not a title; it is certificate to obtain a non-repairable or salvage certificate.

These provisions may also be applied to certain accident-damaged vehicles.

## Real ID Act

Access to some federal facilities is now impacted by the Real ID Act. When seeking to access some federal facilities and buildings, if using a driver's license or state issued identification card as identification, it must comply with the requirements of the Real ID Act at those locations. Refer to www.dhs.gov/real-id-public-faqs for more information on the REAL ID Act. Individuals without licenses from compliant jurisdictions may present alternative forms of identification - such as a U.S. Passport - accepted by the agency. Some agencies may have additional processes to accommodate individuals lacking the prescribed identification documents. Prior to visiting federal facilities, bidders should contact the federal agency property custodian listed on the sale to confirm facility entry documentation requirements.
