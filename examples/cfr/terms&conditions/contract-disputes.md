# Contract Disputes

## Contract Disputes

Contracts resulting from the sale of any offer in the GSAAuctions.gov website are subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 USC 7101-7109), as amended.

Successful Bidders are reminded that an award constitutes a binding contract with the United States Government. The online Terms and Conditions as well as the 114C General Sales Terms and Conditions define the process and conditions under which a bidder may make a claim or dispute a contract. To dispute a contract, bidders must contact the Sales Contracting Officer for the sale. If at any point during the contract appeals process the bidder takes action contrary to the prescribed process and effects a chargeback via his/her credit card company, GSA will be notified and will make every effort to deny the chargeback in lieu of the dispute process. If the bidder has removed the property and is granted a refund by chargeback he/she will be considered to be in possession of stolen property because he/she has breached the contract with the Government by not submitting payment to the Government. Under such circumstances, GSA may take appropriate legal action against the bidder.

Air Pollution Control Devices. The purchaser of any vehicle from the U.S. Government is responsible for having air pollution control devices inspected and or installed and obtaining a certificate of compliance from the appropriate state registration official.

## Condition of Property

The following replaces Clause No. 2 of the General Terms and Conditions of the Standard Form (SF) 114C: Condition of property is not warranted. Deficiencies, when known, have been indicated in the property descriptions. However, absence of any indicated deficiencies does not mean that none exists. Therefore, the bidder should ascertain the condition of the item through physical inspection. Please also reference the Inspection of Property clause.

## Sale of Specialized Property

For items previously held in government custody due to seizures, forfeitures, liens or other legal actions, special terms and conditions apply for items offered on behalf of the IRS. In these instances, Clause 2 of the General Sales Terms and Conditions (SF 114C -2001) is superseded. The Sales Online Clauses are amended, and the following terms apply:

All property is offered for sale ''where is'' and ''as is'' and without recourse against the United States. No guaranty or warranty, express or implied, is made as to the validity of the title, quality, quantity, weight, size, or condition of any of the property, or its fitness for any use or purpose. No claim will be considered for allowance or adjustment or for rescission of the sale based on failure of the property to conform with any expressed or implied representation.

## Description Warranty & Refunds

The Government warrants to the original purchaser that the property listed on GSAAuctions.gov will conform to its written description. Features, characteristics, deficiencies, etc. not addressed in the description are excluded from this warranty. GSA further cautions bidders that GSA's written description represents GSA's best effort to describe the item based on the information provided to it by the owning agency. Therefore, gross omissions regarding the functionality of items, failures to cite major missing parts and/or restrictions with regards to usage may occur.

The Government does not warrant the merchantability of the property or its purpose. The purchaser is not entitled to any payment for loss of profit or any other money damages - special, direct, indirect, or consequential.

## Recalls

Because executive agencies may or may not have made GSA aware of possible recalls, vehicles being sold on GSA Auctions℠ may have outstanding recalls. Potential purchasers should contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at www.nhtsa.gov for more information on recall campaigns. Purchasers should contact a manufacturer's dealership in their local area that services that brand of vehicle to address any outstanding recalls, or to verify that all recalls have been addressed and are repaired. Any outstanding recalls shall be the sole responsibility of the purchaser.

## Pre-award Mis-description

Prior to the closing of a sale, the Government may identify or learn of a gross omission regarding the functionality of an item, major missing parts, and/or restrictions with regards to its use. If GSA is aware of this missed information prior to the close of a sale, the item may be pulled from the sale and resubmitted with the information or re-offered at a later date.

## Refunds Claim Procedures

Please be advised that refunds are not a frequent practice of GSA Auctions℠. A request for refund must be substantiated in writing to the Contracting Officer for issues regarding mis-described property, missing property and voluntary defaults within 15 calendar days from the date of award.

## Refund Amount

The refund is limited to an amount not to exceed the purchase price of the mis-described property.

## Claims of Mis-description

If items have been awarded but not paid for and the successful bidder feels that the property is mis-described, he/she must follow these procedures: A written claim needs to be submitted to the Sales Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days from the date of award requesting release of contractual obligation for reasons satisfying that of a mis-description. No verbal contact with the custodian or the Sales Contracting Officer or any other federal official will constitute a notice of mis-description.

When items are awarded and payment has been received, regardless of the removal status (removal may or may not have occurred), the successful bidder must submit a written notice to the Sales Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days from the date of payment e-mail (the Purchaser's Receipt). If property has been removed and the claim is accepted by the Sales Contracting Officer, the purchaser must maintain the property in its purchased condition and return it at their expense to the location designated by the Sales Contracting Officer or their designated official.

## Default

Bidders are cautioned to bid only on items they are prepared to pay for and remove in accordance with the online sale terms and conditions of this sale. Failure to pay for and remove all awarded items, or all items within a lot within the timeframe specified, could result in termination of the contract for default. The bidder will also be subject to paying liquidated damages plus applicable interest.

The following supersedes Clause No. 9 of the General Terms and Conditions of the Standard Form (SF) 114C:

If you are awarded an item on GSA Auctions℠, you have a responsibility to pay for the item or lot that you were awarded within 2 business days from the date and time the award e-mail notification was sent and promptly remove it within 10 business days from the date and time the award e-mail notification was sent, unless otherwise specified in the contract. If you fail to meet either of these two conditions, you will be in violation of the online sale terms and conditions of your contract with the Government and will be considered "in default".

As a defaulted bidder, you will be responsible for the payment of liquidated damages, an administrative fee for the processing and re-handling of the item for which you neglected to pay for and/or remove. A breakdown of the fee structure follows:

Purchase Price Fee Assessed

If Purchase Price is | The Fee Charged will be
---------------------|-------------------------
<$325.00 | Fee will equal to the award amount
$325.00 - $100,000.00 | Fee will be $325.00
>$100,000.00 | Fee will be equal to 5% of the award amount

The Government shall be entitled to retain (and/or to collect) this amount of the purchase price of the item(s) as to which the default occurred. Please note that in cases where bid deposits are required, the full amount of the bid deposit may be retained for the payment of liquidated damages.

Further, if an item or lot has been paid for but only a portion of the lot has been removed, The purchaser will not be entitled to any kind of refund. The purchaser will lose all rights and title to the property that they failed to remove prior to the removal deadline. Parties who have their contract terminated for default for failure to pay or remove will only be allowed to "browse" items. At the time that liquidated damages are paid, the bidder will be given access to begin bidding on items.

## Liquidated Damages

Liquidated damage payments paid by credit cards are processed by GSA's Finance office on a daily basis. If a credit card is used in payment of liquidated damages owed, it can take up to 2 business days to process this payment and clear a user's GSA Auctions℠ account. Avoid if at all possible, incurring liquidated damages.
