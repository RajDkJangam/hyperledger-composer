# Bidding

## Photographs

Photographs may not depict an exact representation of the bid item(s) and should not be relied upon in place of written item descriptions or as a substitute for physical inspection. Please contact the custodian for inspection dates and times.

GSA makes no representation or warranty regarding use of the photos on this site. Some may be U.S. government work and free from copyright, some may be produced by other than the government and GSA may be using the photograph with permission from the copyright holder. If you have interest in using a particular photo, it is your responsibility to determine if it is copyrighted or available for use without permission.

## Inspection of Property

Bidders agree to physically inspect the property upon which they bid or thereby waive the opportunity to conduct a physical inspection. In waiving their inspection rights, bidders bear the risk for any gross omissions regarding the functionality of items, failures to cite major missing parts and/or restrictions with regards to usage that would have been revealed by physical inspection.There are times when access to property may be limited due to property being located in a restricted area. GSA will do all that it can to ensure that photos and detailed descriptions are provided in these instances.

During an inspection at a government facility, actions taken by bidders are at their own risk. The U.S. Government will not be liable for any or all debts, judgments, costs, demands, suits, actions, or claims of any nature arising from or incident to their inspection at the Government facility, including any injuries that a bidder incurs due to their own actions or neglect on during their visit to a Government facility.

## Reporting Discrepancies/Hazardous Materials

Prospective purchasers are asked to inform the sales office of any discrepancies in the property descriptions discovered while inspecting the property and of any lots in this sale that contain hazardous material/waste not indicated in the property descriptions.

## Oral Statements and Modifications

Any oral statement or representation by any representative of the Government, changing or supplementing the offering or contract or any condition thereof, is unauthorized and shall confer no right upon the bidder or purchaser. Further, no interpretation of any provision of the contract, including applicable performance requirements, shall be binding on the government unless furnished or agreed to, in writing by the Contracting Officer or his designated representative.

## Submission of Bid

Bids are submitted by Proxy (Maximum Bid) or by Flat bid (Current active bid placed). Proxy bidding is the ability to submit the maximum amount that a bidder is willing to pay for an item and to allow the system to incrementally bid on the bidders behalf up to the maximum amount entered. A Flat bid is the lowest (minimum) bid that a bidder can place. Any increase or counter-offer of bidding using the Flat bid method must be manually submitted by the bidder and must meet the bid increment requirement. The system recognizes the maximum dollar amount listed for Proxy bids and in instances when a Proxy bid exceeds a Flat bid by less than the full bid increment, the Proxy bid will still be selected as the high bid because it is always bid to its maximum. In the event that a Proxy bid maximum results in a tie bid with another proxy bid or a flat bid, the time submission of the Proxy bid will be a determining factor for award. The proxy bid that is entered into the system first will be the winning bid.

Bids are only accepted in whole U.S. Dollar amounts. Do not enter dollar signs ($) commas (,), periods (.) or cents (¢). Bidding will begin and end at the dates and times specified for each lot in the GSAAuctions.gov website. Please note: The times displayed at GSA Auctions℠ are in Central time. In addition, certain auctions are designed to extend the closing time if there is bidding activity. The extended bidding time varies with each auction. Bidders are urged to review the bidding details and enhanced bidding logic at GSA Auctions℠ for auction details. It is the responsibility of the bidder to follow-up on the status of his/her bid.

When bidding on property via GSAAuctions.gov, funds or monies should be readily available; GSA is not obligated to wait for bidders to arrange for financing.

## Consideration of Bid

It is the policy of GSA Auctions℠ to monitor bids and other activity to ensure the proper use of GSAAuctions.gov. The Government reserves the right to reject any and all bids. Bids can be rejected for any reason, especially those containing inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information, or information which is deemed to have been given in bad faith. GSA Auctions℠ monitors for suspicious bids. Such bids are subject to investigation and cancellation at any time. If GSA Auctions℠ removes a bid, the bidder with the next highest bid, who is in compliance with the online terms and conditions, will become the current high bid. It is a violation of law to submit bids using a false name or any other fraudulent information, and such bids may not be processed, even if GSA Auctions℠ initially accepts a bid. Be aware that if you provide false information, GSA Auctions℠ will remove you from the database and may pursue all legal means available to the Federal Government to prosecute.

## Modification of Bids

The following replaces Clause No. 3.(b) of the General Terms and Conditions of the Standard Form (SF) 114C: Bids received for items offered in the GSAAuctions.gov website may be raised before the closing date and time, as specified in the offering. Proxy bid limits may be replaced with a higher or lower proxy bid limit provided that the amount is greater than or equal to the minimum bid required by the system. A bidder cannot lower a proxy if the new, lower amount has already been exceeded. The minimum bid is the current high bid plus the amount of the bid increment. Proxy bid limits placed in the system may also be replaced with a flat bid; the flat bid will cancel the proxy bid limit. Additionally, the flat bid must be greater than or equal to the minimum bid required by the system. The minimum bid is the current winning bid plus the amount of the bid increment. Flat (minimum) bids may be replaced with proxy bid limit. Proxy bid limit must be greater than or equal to the minimum bid required by the system. Bidders cannot cancel bids.

## Bid Closings

A sale is considered closed when the countdown clock goes down to zero (0); the system will automatically refresh the browser page once. Next to "time remaining," it will either (a) state the new remaining time after a sale extension due to bidding activity or (b) state that the sale is closed. For items offered under special sales authority, no bid extension will be activated due to bidding activity and the sale will close at the time listed. Bidders are cautioned that bids submitted within the last seconds of the sale closing risk the loss of submission/acceptance due to any number of factors, including the bidder's internet connectivity and the system's speed. In cases of disputes, only recorded bids will be considered.

## Notification of Sale Results

Successful bidders will be notified by e-mail and must contact the regional sales office within two (2) business days from the date and time the award e-mail notification was sent to make payment. Bid results will not be furnished via telephone or fax. It is the bidder's responsibility to follow-up on the status of the auction and to ensure that the bidder's e-mail address and all registration data are kept accurate and up-to-date. If at any time, the bidder's information changes, it is the bidder's responsibility to update the appropriate information on GSAAuctions.gov. Warning: If any e-mails are undeliverable and returned due to an inaccurate e-mail address, GSA may remove such registrants from the database. Undelivered e-mails do not excuse a successful bidder's obligation to complete contractual obligations made with GSA. These contractual obligations include making timely payments and removing awarded property within the time specified. Failure to do so, will result in a termination for default. Sales results may be obtained by a successful bidder in their personal summary after the sale closes.

## Bid Extensions

Occasionally, technical problems will interrupt the bidding process for an unspecified amount of time. These interruptions may affect some or all bidders. In the event of an interruption, an evaluation of the length of interruption time and the numbers of bidders affected may prompt GSA Auctions℠ to extend the closing time for an auction. Extension may range from 1 hour to 24 hours based on the aforementioned criteria, to ensure fair and full competition. An e-mail notification will be sent to those bidders who participated in these auctions when there are extensions due to technical problems. Bidders must monitor their bidding activity online to obtain new closing dates and times when these extensions occur.

For "specialty items" offered on behalf of the IRS, the sale closing will end no later than 11:59 PM on the day of the sale without the option for bid extensions.

## Canceled Auctions

Due to technical problems encountered from time to time, situations may arise that warrant GSA canceling awards because full and open competition consistent with the value and nature of the property was not met. Items may be reoffered at a later date. An e-mail notification will be sent to those bidders who participated in these auctions when they are canceled.

## Terminated Auctions

It may be necessary to withdraw items from bidding due to technical errors or uncontrollable circumstances. Auctions may be terminated because the property is no longer available due to Federal or state agency needs; property becomes damaged; property is stolen, or property was improperly described. Items may be reoffered at a later date. An e-mail notification will be sent to those bidders who participated in these auctions when they are terminated.

## Reoffering and Resale of Items

Please be advised that items that are available on GSA Auctions℠ are considered property of the Federal Government until which time it is awarded, paid for and removed from Federal premises. As such, this property may not be advertised, offered, pre-sold or otherwise represented as the property of any bidder for personal gain, prior to the award, payment and full possession of items/lots by the awarded bidder. Actions made in violations of this warning may result in legal action and prosecution against the awarded bidder, by the Government.

The offerings on this website are considered proprietary and are not available for use by third parties to promote, advertise, or otherwise sell allegedly on behalf of the Government. Such actions would require a contractual agreement with GSA Auctions℠, which such agreement will not be granted. Please be advised that any cost for such marketing efforts will not be reimbursed by GSA, and any representation allegedly on behalf of GSA will be considered fraudulent.

## Blocked from Bidding

In the event bidders provide false information, bid using unacceptable/profane usernames, or default for non-payment or non-removal, they will lose all rights to place bids for other items. They will only be allowed to "browse" the items. At such time the bidder cures his/her default, he/she will be unblocked and be given access to begin bidding on items. With regards to improper usernames, the bidder will be contacted and asked to re-register using a more appropriate username and the "offensively named" account will be blocked to prevent further use.
